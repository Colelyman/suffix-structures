===== Suffix Structure Implementation ===== 
by Cole Lyman, Brigham Young University Computational Science Lab
==== Purpose ====
The purpose of this implementation is to create an efficient implementation
of various suffix structures (suffix array, suffix tree, and suffix cacts).
==== Input ====
To generate the suffix structure, a reference string is the input.
A query string will need to be provided as well.
==== Output ====
The output will be an index of where the query string is located in the reference.
If the query is not present in the reference, a -1 will be returned.
